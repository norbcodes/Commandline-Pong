<h1> Pong in the CMD minigame.</h1>
<p>This was made as a minigame for <a href="https://github.com/MF366-Coding/The-Ultimate-Minigame-Collection">MF366's Minigame Collection.</a></p> 
<p>Released as standalone for all to play :)</p>
<h1>How to play?</h1>
<p>Before everything, you need Python 3.10 which you can download <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here.</a>
Now let's get started :)
</p>
<h3>1. Download the repo</h3>
<p>Click on "Code" and click "Download ZIP"<br>This will download the entire repository.<br>
Or get the latest release of this repo <a href="https://github.com/norbcodes/Commandline-Pong/releases">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>2. Install necessary modules</h3>
You can do this by doing <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code><br>
The requirements.txt already comes with the repo.
<h3>3. Run the script</h3>
<p>Simply do <code>python PongEngine.py</code>.<br>
If you have downloaded everything successfully, the game shouldn't crash on boot.<br>
And if it didn't, have fun :)</p>
<h3>Quick note for Linux users</h3>
<p>Note that for Linux users, you'll need to run the script as <code>sudo</code>, due to the Python module <code>keyboard</code> requiring it.</p>
